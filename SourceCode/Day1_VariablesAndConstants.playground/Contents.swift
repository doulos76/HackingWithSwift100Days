//: Simple types: Summary

//You make variables using `var` and constants using `let`. Itâ€™s preferable to use constants as often as possible.
//Strings start and end with double quotes, but if you want them to run across multiple lines you should use three sets of double quotes.
//Integers hold whole numbers, doubles hold fractional numbers, and booleans hold true or false.
//String interpolation allows you to create strings from other variables and constants, placing their values inside your string.
//Swift uses type inference to assign each variable or constant a type, but you can provide explicit types if you want.
